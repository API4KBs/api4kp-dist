  title: API4KP Knowledge Base Construction API
  description: |2

    The Knowledge Base (KB) Construction APIs allow to compose one or more Knowledge Assets into
    Knowledge Bases that are suitable for processing/reasoning.
    The process, which is driven by metadata (surrogates), involves the retrieval, normalization,
    and structuring of Knowledge Artifacts that manifest the components of the Knowledge Base itself.

    As such, implementations of this API are likely to depend on the API4KP Knowledge Trans*ion APIs and, more loosely, on the API4KP Knowledge Asset Repository API.
    This API, in turn, is designed to be a dependency of the API4PK Reasoning/Inference APIs.

    The API is inspired by the State monad. Knowledge Bases are incubated within the server from their initialization, through their construction, until their finalization and retrieval.
    As operations are applied to manipulate the KB, new versions are constructed ensuring reproducibility and traceabiilty.
    Implementations, however, are not required nor guaranteed to be transactional.

      summary: Constructs a Composite Knowledge Asset
      description: |
        Creates a new Composite Knowledge Asset (with a new AssetID), which is manifested
        by means of its 'structure'.
        The client is responsible to provide a 'definition', expressed in some query language
        (e.g. SPARQL), which should cover both extensional (i.e. enumerated) and intensional
        (i.e. query proper) ways to select component assets and their relationships.
        The server is expected to run that definition against a substrate, such as a Knowledge
        Asset Repository.
        The server will return a KnowledgeCarrier, wrapping the graph that results from the
        application of the definition with minimal asset metadata (id, version) and information
        on how the graph itself is represented.

        The client can use the structure to assemble a Composite Asset Surrogate, or a Composite
        Artifact, which in turn could be fed to an Introspector to infer an overall Surrogate
        for the composite itself
